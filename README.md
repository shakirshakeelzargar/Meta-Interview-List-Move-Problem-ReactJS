# List Move Problem - ReactJS

A simple ReactJS application for moving list items between two lists using checkboxes. This project was originally created as part of a meta interview problem.

## Description

Welcome to the META React JS interview.

Your task is to build a transfer list component.

A transfer list allows users to pass items from one list to another.
UX has provided a mock up.

The transfer list should consists of two lists with directional actions buttons.
The user should be able to select one or multiple items and move the item 
to the other list by clicking the action buttons.



This ReactJS application provides a user interface for moving items between two lists using checkboxes. It's a common scenario where you have two lists, and you want to select items from one list and move them to the other.

The application consists of two lists, List 1 and List 2, each containing a set of checkboxes associated with list items. You can:

- Select checkboxes in List 1 and click the `>>>>>>` button to move the selected items to List 2.
- Select checkboxes in List 2 and click the `<<<<<<` button to move the selected items back to List 1.

The state of the checkboxes and the lists is managed using React state hooks, and the UI components are styled using Material-UI.
